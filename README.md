# Decision Tree vs Random Forest Regression

This project compares the performance of Decision Tree and Random Forest regression models on a dataset using Python and scikit-learn.

## Objective
To understand how ensemble learning (Random Forest) improves performance compared to a single Decision Tree model.

## Models Used
- DecisionTreeRegressor
- RandomForestRegressor

## Evaluation Metric
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## What I Learned
- How train-test split affects model evaluation
- Why Random Forest generally performs better than Decision Trees
- The importance of model evaluation using MAE
